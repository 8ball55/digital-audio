# Shyan's Digital Audio Projects

Hey! My name is Shyan Shafii, I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate student specializing in circuit design and opticalelectronics/semiconductors and minoring in Japanese Language & Literature at University of California, Irvine. My interests in electronics are mostly musical applications of electronic hardware/software which is why I decided to undertake the course computer music programming (MUS147/CS190) and develop my skills in what I actually want to do with field in the future. This website is where I showcase my works for digital audio that I have done in the computer music programming course at UCI.
